![Configurator](Images/configurator_screenshot_01.png)

### Configurator
The Configurator provides a user interface to configure and manage the MTConnect Agent and Adapters. The Agent is setup during install and each Adapter can be added/removed using the Configurator. When a device is added, the appropriate adapter is installed, the adapter is added to the agent.cfg file, and the Device is added to the devices.xml file.

### Agent
The agent is based on the cppagent project available at https://github.com/mtconnect/cppagent.

### Adapters
The adapters are based on the Fanuc adapter that is part of the project available at https://github.com/mtconnect/adapter/tree/master/fanuc.

### Step 6

The Add Device dialog will open with the list of available controller types on the left side. Click the controller type matching the Fanuc control you are connecting to. 
*(Note: controller types are listed by "family". For example, a 31i controller would use the 30i Adapter)*

### Step 9

Once the status for the newly added Device changes to "Started", the Agent is ready to be used and can be accessed using a web browser (Firefox, Chrome, IE, etc.) by navigating to "http://127.0.0.1:5000/current". Once all of the devices needed are setup, you can close the Configurator window.
